      items:
        - Broadband Thermal Meta-optics
          -  Employed an inverse-design framework to create broadband meta-optics operating in the long-wave infrared (LWIR) regime (8-12 μm).
        - Optical Neural Network
          -  Designed an incoherent optical neural network capable of classifying MNIST characters using a meta-optical doublet.
        - Meta-optical Fiber Endoscope
          -  Designed large meta-optics for real time full-color imaging in a meta-optical fiber endoscope.
        - Polarization Sensitive Foveated LWIR meta-optics
          -  Designed polarization sensitive meta-optics in the LWIR regime, which has polarization multiplexed focal lengths.
        - All-silicon LWIR Metalens
          -  Built a metalens imaging platform in the long wavelength infrared (LWIR).
        - Inverse Designed Achromatic LWIR
          -  Inverse designed an achromatic LWIR imaging system, which is currently being fabricated. The optimization of the optics is enabled by techniques such as automatic differentiation and deep learning.
        - Liquid Crystal Tunable Metasurface
          -  Designed metasurfaces with tunable functionalities such as notch filters and beam steering using liquid crystal. Fabricated these metasurface for liquid crystal integration.
        - Extended Depth of Focus Metasurface
          - Built an achromatic imaging platform combining the form factor of ultra-thin metasurface and computational imaging. This imaging system utilizes the extended depth of focus (EDOF) property to enable full-color imaging.
        - Forward Designed Composite Metasurface
          - Developed a doublet metasurface fabrication process flow. Designed metasurface doublets using Zemax. Developed python script to automate optimization and analyses on Zemax.
