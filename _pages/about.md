As a relentless inquirer into the nature of the physical world, my enduring drive is to broaden my intellectual horizons and deepen my understanding of our complex universe.

Professionally, I am engaged in the exciting field of developing diffractive optical systems. It is a privilege to work at the frontier of novel optical technologies, given my long-standing passion for optics. Coding presents another area of professional interest for me, where I find immense satisfaction and fun.

Outside the laboratory, my hobbies pull together the threads of creativity and aesthetics. Tinkering with tunes on the piano, capturing visual narratives through photography, and expressing my imagination through crafting enable me to balance my intensely technical work with artful leisure activities.
